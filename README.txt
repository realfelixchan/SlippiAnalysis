This is going to be a project that will utilize the fanmade packages, slippi-js to read slp files 
generated by playing SSBM games on the Slippi emulator. (node.js is required)
The goal is to be able to generate a few key statistics that will help the player see where their strengths lie, and where to improve, then have them uploaded to a DB.
