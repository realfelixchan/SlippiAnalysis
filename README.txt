This is going to be a project that will utilize two fanmade packages, slippi-js (Javascript) and py-slippi (Python) to read slp files 
generated by playing SSBM games on the Slippi emulator. The required library not mentioned in the requirements is slippi-js@5.1.1, and also requires node.js.
The goal is to be able to generate a few key statistics that will help the player see where their strengths lie, and where to improve.
